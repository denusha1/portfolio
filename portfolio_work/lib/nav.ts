 * Section navigation for the header, the mobile sheet and the command
 * palette. One helper so the three can't drift apart.
 *
 * The scroll itself is instant — `globals.css` sets `scroll-behavior: smooth`
 * on <html> and `scrollIntoView` inherits that unless a behaviour is named,
 * so `"instant"` is doing real work. The movement between sections is then
 * covered by a View Transition, which cross-fades the before and after, so
 * arriving reads as a page change rather than a jump cut.
 *
 * It also writes the hash, which `preventDefault` on the anchor otherwise
 * suppresses — without it sections aren't linkable and Back does nothing.
