  bio: [
    "I'm a third-year Information Technology & Management undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa, currently at a 3.53 CGPA. Most of what I know about building software came from projects rather than lectures — designing the data model, writing the REST API, and then living with the frontend decisions I made two weeks earlier.",
    "The work I've spent the most time on is a performance management system, where I owned the evaluation and approval workflow: the multi-level review chain, the status model underneath it, and the screens reviewers actually use. Alongside web development I'm working through data science and machine learning with NumPy, pandas and scikit-learn. I'm looking for an internship where I can keep building next to engineers who will tell me when I'm wrong.",
